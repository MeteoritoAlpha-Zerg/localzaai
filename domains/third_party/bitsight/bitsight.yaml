      An existing BitSight instance with valid API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of BitSight companies and portfolios using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given BitSightConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real companies and portfolios, and not simulated;

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the BitSight connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "BitSightConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which companies and portfolios are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which companies and portfolios to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "support BitSight's API token authentication method",
      "handle rate limiting appropriately for BitSight API constraints",
      "support BitSight's security rating methodology and risk vector analysis",
      "integrate with BitSight's vendor risk management and portfolio capabilities"
