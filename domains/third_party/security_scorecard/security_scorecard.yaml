      A data connector implementation per the provided interfaces
    postconditions: |
      The data connector is able to provide a list of supported tools and interfaces
    function_to_run: !python/file 1-test_tools_interface.py

  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates SecurityScorecard data sources
    preconditions: |
      Valid SecurityScorecard API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of SecurityScorecard data sources using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given SecurityScorecardConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real data sources, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve SecurityScorecard security scores and risk ratings
    preconditions: |

      This list includes overall ratings, factor scores, and risk assessments; 
      These must be real score data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_get_scores.py

  - description: |

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the SecurityScorecard connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "SecurityScorecardConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which data sources are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which sources to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "SecurityScorecard APIs require proper API token authentication in headers",
      "implement proper rate limiting and pagination handling for large datasets",
      "handle different data types (scores, issues, portfolios, vendors, ratings) appropriately",
      "support SecurityScorecard's RESTful API architecture and response formats",
      "handle SecurityScorecard's specific response formats and error codes properly",
      "implement proper handling of SecurityScorecard's risk rating methodology and scoring",
      "support SecurityScorecard's vendor risk management and portfolio capabilities"
