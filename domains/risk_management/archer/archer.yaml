    preconditions: |
      A data connector implementation per the provided interfaces
    postconditions: |
      The data connector is able to provide a list of supported tools and interfaces
    function_to_run: !python/file 1-test_tools_interface.py

  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates RSA Archer data sources
    preconditions: |
      Valid RSA Archer API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of RSA Archer data sources using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given RSAArcherConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real data sources, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve RSA Archer GRC records and compliance data
    preconditions: |
      Valid RSA Archer API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve GRC records by way of connector tools;
      This list includes compliance data, risk assessments, and control evaluations; 
      These must be real GRC data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_get_records.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve RSA Archer incident management data
    preconditions: |
      Valid RSA Archer API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve incident management data including security incidents and investigations;
      This list includes incident details, status tracking, and remediation information; 
      These must be real incident data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_get_incidents.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve RSA Archer risk management and assessment data
    preconditions: |
      Valid RSA Archer API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve risk management data including assessments and mitigation plans;
      This list includes risk scores, mitigation strategies, and governance workflows; 
      These must be real risk data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 6-test_get_risks.py

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the RSA Archer connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "RSAArcherConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which data sources are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which sources to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "RSA Archer APIs require session-based authentication with username/password",
      "implement proper session management and token handling for RSA Archer",
      "handle different data types (applications, records, incidents, risks, controls) appropriately",
      "support RSA Archer's application-based data model and field structures",
      "handle RSA Archer's specific response formats and error codes per API specification",
      "implement proper handling of RSA Archer's complex field types and relationships"
