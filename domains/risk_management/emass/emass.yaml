      and to then use this to set the options in a given eMASSConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real systems and packages, and not simulated;

    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve security control assessments and implementation status from selected systems;
      This query returns actual control assessment data from the target systems; 
      These must be real control assessments, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_control_assessments.py

  - description: |

      "utilize the query target options to determine which systems and assessment packages are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which data sources to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "focus on compliance data, security control assessments, and risk management reports",
      "support filtering by control implementation status, POA&M status, and compliance levels for targeted analysis",
      "handle both individual system assessments and aggregated compliance reporting capabilities",
      "include NIST controls, FISMA compliance levels, and POA&M tracking for comprehensive risk management",
      "support certificate-based authentication as required by eMASS API"
