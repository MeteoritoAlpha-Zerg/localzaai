      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates ExtraHop sensor networks
    preconditions: |
      An existing ExtraHop API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of ExtraHop sensor networks using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given ExtraHopConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real sensor networks, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List ExtraHop network telemetry for selected sensor networks in target
    preconditions: |
      An existing ExtraHop API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of ExtraHop network telemetry by way of connector tools;
      This list includes details of the telemetry data to be listed in results; 
      These must be real telemetry data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_network_telemetry.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve anomaly detection data and threat indicators for selected networks
    preconditions: |
      An existing ExtraHop API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve anomaly detection data and threat indicators for the selected networks as passed as params to the connector tools;
      This list only includes anomaly data of the target networks to be listed in results; 
      These must be real anomaly detection data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_anomaly_detection.py

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the ExtraHop connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "ExtraHopConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which sensor networks are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which networks to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "handle ExtraHop-specific data structures like detections, devices, protocols, and metrics appropriately",
      "respect ExtraHop API rate limits and implement proper error handling for telemetry data",
      "support different ExtraHop modules like Reveal(x), Command Platform, and Trace as needed",
      "handle time-based queries and filtering for network telemetry and analytics data",
      "support ExtraHop's wire data analysis and behavioral analytics capabilities"
