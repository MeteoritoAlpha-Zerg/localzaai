      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the Twilio connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "TwilioConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which phone numbers are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which phone numbers to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "Twilio API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with Account SID and Auth Token",
      "Handle Twilio-specific message statuses (queued, sent, delivered, failed, etc.)",
      "Support both sending and receiving SMS messages",
      "Follow Twilio API rate limiting best practices",
      "Handle webhook configurations for real-time message updates when applicable"
