      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the WhatsApp connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "WhatsAppConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which phone numbers are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which phone numbers to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "WhatsApp Business API uses Bearer token authentication with Access Token",
      "Handle WhatsApp-specific message types (text, image, document, template, etc.)",
      "Support both sending and receiving messages through webhooks",
      "Follow Meta's WhatsApp Business API rate limiting guidelines",
      "Handle message template approval process and template-based messaging",
      "Support rich media messaging including images, documents, and location"
