      This checks to see that the connector is able to return a listing of tools
    preconditions: |
      A data connector implementation per the provided interfaces
    postconditions: |
      The data connector is able to provide a list of supported tools and interfaces
    function_to_run: !python/file 1-test_tools_interface.py

  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates RunZero data sources
    preconditions: |
      Valid RunZero API token
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of RunZero data sources using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given RunZeroConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real data sources, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve RunZero asset inventory and network discovery data
    preconditions: |
      Valid RunZero API token
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve asset inventory by way of connector tools;
      This list includes asset details, IP addresses, and discovered services; 
      These must be real asset data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_get_assets.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve RunZero network services and protocol information
    preconditions: |
      Valid RunZero API token
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve network services including port and protocol information;
      This list includes service details, banners, and application identification; 
      These must be real service data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_get_services.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve RunZero network scan results and discovery insights
    preconditions: |
      Valid RunZero API token
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve scan results and network discovery insights;
      This list includes scan metadata, discovery results, and network topology; 
      These must be real scan data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 6-test_get_scans.py

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the RunZero connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "RunZeroConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which data sources are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which sources to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "RunZero APIs require proper API token authentication in headers",
      "implement proper rate limiting and pagination handling for large datasets",
      "handle different data types (assets, services, networks, scans) appropriately",
      "support RunZero's organization-based data access model",
      "handle RunZero's specific response formats and data structures per API specification"
