      The data connector is able to provide a list of supported tools and interfaces
    function_to_run: !python/file 1-test_tools_interface.py

  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates OpenDNS organizations
    preconditions: |
      An existing OpenDNS (Cisco Umbrella) API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of OpenDNS organizations using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given OpenDNSConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real organizations, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List OpenDNS security events for selected organizations in target
    preconditions: |
      An existing OpenDNS (Cisco Umbrella) API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of OpenDNS security events by way of connector tools;
      This list includes details of the security events to be listed in results; 
      These must be real security events, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_security_events.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve threat intelligence and domain categorization data for selected domains
    preconditions: |
      An existing OpenDNS (Cisco Umbrella) API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve threat intelligence and domain categorization data for the selected domains as passed as params to the connector tools;
      This list only includes threat intelligence of the target domains to be listed in results; 
      These must be real threat intelligence data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_threat_intelligence.py

  - description: |
      Generate DNS security analytics and reporting data
    preconditions: |
      An existing OpenDNS (Cisco Umbrella) API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to generate DNS security analytics and reporting data based on security events and traffic patterns;
      Results should contain meaningful security metrics and analytics insights;
      These must be real analytics data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 6-test_security_analytics.py

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the OpenDNS (Cisco Umbrella) connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "OpenDNSConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which organizations are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which organizations to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "handle OpenDNS-specific data structures like security events, domain categories, policy events, and analytics data appropriately",
      "respect OpenDNS API rate limits and implement proper error handling for DNS security data",
      "support different Umbrella modules like DNS Security, Web Security, and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) as needed",
      "handle time-based queries and filtering for security events and analytics data"
