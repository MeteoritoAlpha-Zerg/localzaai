    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates Reach SOAR workflows and playbooks
    preconditions: |
      An existing Reach SOAR API token and server access
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Reach SOAR workflows and playbooks using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given ReachSOARConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real workflows and playbooks, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List Reach SOAR workflows for selected targets
    preconditions: |
      An existing Reach SOAR API token and server access
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Reach SOAR workflows by way of connector tools;
      This list includes metadata and automation capabilities for security orchestration; 
      These must be real workflows, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_list_workflows.py

  - description: |
      Execute workflows and manage incidents from selected Reach SOAR playbooks
    preconditions: |
      An existing Reach SOAR API token and server access with execution permissions
    postconditions: |
      Possible to execute security workflows and manage incident response from selected playbooks;
      This execution returns actual workflow results from the target playbooks; 
      These must be real workflow executions, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_workflow_execution.py

  - description: |
      Process threat intelligence and automated response actions
    preconditions: |
      An existing Reach SOAR API token and server access with threat intelligence processing
    postconditions: |
      Possible to process threat intelligence data and execute automated response actions;
      The processing should support comprehensive security orchestration use cases;
      Results must demonstrate actual threat intelligence processing capabilities;
    function_to_run: !python/file 6-test_threat_intelligence.py

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the Reach SOAR connector

    value: [
      "ReachSOARConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which workflows and playbooks are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which automation workflows to actually execute from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "focus on security workflow automation, incident response management, and threat intelligence processing",
      "support filtering by workflow status, incident priority, and playbook categories for targeted orchestration",
      "handle both individual workflow execution and bulk automation processing capabilities",
      "include incident management, case tracking, and automated response actions for comprehensive SOAR functionality",
      "support multi-tenant environments with proper tenant isolation and access controls"
