    function_to_run: !python/file 1-test_tools_interface.py

  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates Cortex XSOAR investigation teams
    preconditions: |
      An existing Cortex XSOAR API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Cortex XSOAR investigation teams using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given XSOARConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real investigation teams, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List Cortex XSOAR incidents for selected investigation teams in target
    preconditions: |
      An existing Cortex XSOAR API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Cortex XSOAR incidents by way of connector tools;
      This list includes details of the incidents to be listed in results; 
      These must be real incidents, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_incidents.py

  - description: |
      Execute automation tasks and playbooks for selected incidents
    preconditions: |
      An existing Cortex XSOAR API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to execute automation tasks and playbooks for the selected incidents as passed as params to the connector tools;
      This list only includes automation results of the target incidents to be listed in results; 
      These must be real automation executions, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_automation.py

  - description: |
      Manage incident response workflows and orchestration
    preconditions: |
      An existing Cortex XSOAR API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to manage incident response workflows and orchestration based on security incidents;
      Results should contain meaningful workflow execution and orchestration data;
      These must be real workflow results, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 6-test_orchestration.py

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the Cortex XSOAR connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "XSOARConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which investigation teams are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which teams to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "handle Cortex XSOAR-specific data structures like incidents, playbooks, tasks, and automation results appropriately",
      "respect Cortex XSOAR API rate limits and implement proper error handling for automation data",
      "support different XSOAR modules like Incident Management, Playbook Automation, and Integration Management as needed",
      "handle workflow orchestration and task execution with proper status tracking"
