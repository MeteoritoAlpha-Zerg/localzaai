  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates Rapid7 InsightIDR data sources
    preconditions: |
      Valid Rapid7 InsightIDR API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Rapid7 InsightIDR data sources using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given Rapid7InsightIDRConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real data sources, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve Rapid7 InsightIDR security investigations and alerts
    preconditions: |
      Valid Rapid7 InsightIDR API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve security investigations by way of connector tools;
      This list includes investigation details, priority levels, and status information; 
      These must be real investigation data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_get_investigations.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve Rapid7 InsightIDR security logs and event data
    preconditions: |
      Valid Rapid7 InsightIDR API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve security logs including event sources and timestamps;
      This list includes log entries, user activities, and normalized event information; 
      These must be real log data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_get_logs.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve Rapid7 InsightIDR asset and user behavior data

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the Rapid7 InsightIDR connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "Rapid7InsightIDRConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which data sources are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which sources to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "Rapid7 InsightIDR APIs require proper API key authentication in headers",
      "implement proper rate limiting and pagination handling for large datasets",
      "handle different data types (investigations, alerts, logs, assets, users) appropriately",
      "support Rapid7 InsightIDR's RESTful API architecture and response formats",
      "handle Rapid7 InsightIDR's specific response formats and error codes properly",
      "implement proper handling of Rapid7 InsightIDR's time-based queries and filters",
      "support Rapid7 InsightIDR's user behavior analytics and threat detection capabilities"
