      This checks to see that the connector is able to return a listing of tools
    preconditions: |
      A data connector implementation per the provided interfaces
    postconditions: |
      The data connector is able to provide a list of supported tools and interfaces
    function_to_run: !python/file 1-test_tools_interface.py

  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates Siemplify environments
    preconditions: |
      An existing Siemplify (Chronicle SOAR) API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Siemplify environments using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given SimemplifyConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real environments, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List Siemplify cases for selected environments in target
    preconditions: |
      An existing Siemplify (Chronicle SOAR) API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Siemplify cases by way of connector tools;
      This list includes details of the cases to be listed in results; 
      These must be real cases, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_cases.py

  - description: |
      Execute playbooks and automation actions for selected cases
    preconditions: |
      An existing Siemplify (Chronicle SOAR) API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to execute playbooks and automation actions for the selected cases as passed as params to the connector tools;
      This list only includes automation results of the target cases to be listed in results; 
      These must be real automation executions, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_playbooks.py

  - description: |
      Manage case workflows and orchestration
    preconditions: |
      An existing Siemplify (Chronicle SOAR) API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to manage case workflows and orchestration based on security cases;
      Results should contain meaningful workflow execution and orchestration data;
      These must be real workflow results, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 6-test_case_orchestration.py

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the Siemplify (Chronicle SOAR) connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "SimemplifyConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which environments are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which environments to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "handle Siemplify-specific data structures like cases, alerts, entities, and automation results appropriately",
      "respect Siemplify API rate limits and implement proper error handling for automation data",
      "support different Siemplify modules like Case Management, Playbook Automation, and Integration Hub as needed",
      "handle workflow orchestration and entity enrichment with proper status tracking"
