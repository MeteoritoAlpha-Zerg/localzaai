tests:
  - description: |
      This checks to see that the connector is able to return a listing of tools
    preconditions: |
      A data connector implementation per the provided interfaces
    postconditions: |
      The data connector is able to provide a list of supported tools and interfaces
    function_to_run: !python/file 1-test_tools_interface.py

  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates MISP organizations
    preconditions: |
      An existing MISP API key and credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of MISP organizations using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given MISPConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real organizations, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List MISP events for selected organizations in target
    preconditions: |
      An existing MISP API key and credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of MISP events by way of connector tools;
      This list includes details of the events to be listed in results; 
      These must be real events, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_list_events.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve IOCs and attributes for selected MISP events
    preconditions: |
      An existing MISP API key and credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve IOCs and attributes for the selected MISP events as passed as params to the connector tools;
      This list only includes IOCs of the target events to be listed in results; 
      These must be real IOCs, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_ioc_retrieval.py

  - description: |
      Search for threat intelligence based on attribute criteria
    preconditions: |
      An existing MISP API key and credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to search for events and attributes based on search criteria such as attribute type or value;
      Results should contain relevant threat intelligence data matching the search criteria;
      These must be real search results, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 6-test_threat_intelligence_search.py

    description: |
      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the MISP connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "MISPConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which organizations are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which organizations to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "handle MISP-specific data structures like events, attributes, objects, and galaxies appropriately",
      "respect MISP's API rate limits and implement proper error handling for threat intelligence data"
