  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates Cisco AMP computers and groups
    preconditions: |
      An existing Cisco AMP instance with valid API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Cisco AMP computers and groups using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given CiscoAMPConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real computers and groups, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List Cisco AMP computers and groups for selected targets
    preconditions: |
      An existing Cisco AMP instance with valid API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Cisco AMP computers and groups by way of connector tools;
      This list includes details of the computers and groups including metadata and status; 
      These must be real computers and groups, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_list_computers.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve malware detections and security events from selected Cisco AMP computers and groups
    preconditions: |
      An existing Cisco AMP instance with valid API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve malware detections and security events from the selected Cisco AMP computers and groups as passed as params to the connector tools;
      This list only includes events from the target computers and groups to be listed in results; 
      These must be real events, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_event_retrieval.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve file trajectories and hash information from Cisco AMP
    preconditions: |

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the Cisco AMP connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "CiscoAMPConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which computers and groups are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which computers and groups to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "support Cisco AMP's Basic Authentication using client_id and api_key",
      "handle rate limiting appropriately for Cisco AMP API constraints",
      "support common event types: malware detections, quarantine events, file executions, network events, and cloud IOC events"
