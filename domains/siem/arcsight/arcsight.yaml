    preconditions: |
      A data connector implementation per the provided interfaces
    postconditions: |
      The data connector is able to provide a list of supported tools and interfaces
    function_to_run: !python/file 1-test_tools_interface.py

  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates ArcSight security managers
    preconditions: |
      An existing ArcSight API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of ArcSight security managers using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given ArcSightConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real security managers, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List ArcSight security events for selected security managers in target
    preconditions: |
      An existing ArcSight API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of ArcSight security events by way of connector tools;
      This list includes details of the security events to be listed in results; 
      These must be real security events, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_security_events.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve active list data and security intelligence for selected active lists
    preconditions: |
      An existing ArcSight API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve active list data and security intelligence for the selected active lists as passed as params to the connector tools;
      This list only includes intelligence data of the target active lists to be listed in results; 
      These must be real active list data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_active_lists.py

  - description: |
      Execute security searches and generate analytics
    preconditions: |
      An existing ArcSight API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to execute security searches and generate analytics based on event data and correlation rules;
      Results should contain meaningful security metrics and search results;
      These must be real search results, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 6-test_security_search.py

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the ArcSight connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "ArcSightConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which security managers are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which security managers to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "handle ArcSight-specific data structures like events, active lists, cases, and correlation data appropriately",
      "respect ArcSight API rate limits and implement proper error handling for security data",
      "support different ArcSight modules like ESM, Logger, and Investigation as needed",
      "handle time-based queries and filtering for security events and analytics data",
      "support ArcSight CEF (Common Event Format) parsing and processing"
