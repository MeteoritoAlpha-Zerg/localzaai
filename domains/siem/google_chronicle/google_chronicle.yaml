    preconditions: |
      A data connector implementation per the provided interfaces
    postconditions: |
      The data connector is able to provide a list of supported tools and interfaces
    function_to_run: !python/file 1-test_tools_interface.py

  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates Google Chronicle data sources
    preconditions: |
      An existing Google Chronicle API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Google Chronicle data sources using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given ChronicleConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real data sources, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List Google Chronicle security events for selected data sources in target
    preconditions: |
      An existing Google Chronicle API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Google Chronicle security events by way of connector tools;
      This list includes details of the security events to be listed in results; 
      These must be real security events, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_security_events.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve threat intelligence and IoC data for selected indicators
    preconditions: |
      An existing Google Chronicle API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve threat intelligence and IoC data for the selected indicators as passed as params to the connector tools;
      This list only includes threat intelligence of the target indicators to be listed in results; 
      These must be real threat intelligence data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_threat_intelligence.py

  - description: |
      Execute UDM searches and generate security analytics
    preconditions: |
      An existing Google Chronicle API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to execute UDM searches and generate security analytics based on security data and detection rules;
      Results should contain meaningful security metrics and search results;
      These must be real search results, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 6-test_udm_search.py

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the Google Chronicle connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "ChronicleConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which data sources are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which data sources to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "handle Google Chronicle-specific data structures like UDM events, detection results, IoCs, and analytics data appropriately",
      "respect Google Chronicle API rate limits and implement proper error handling for security data",
      "support different Chronicle modules like Detection Engine, Search, and Threat Intelligence as needed",
      "handle time-based queries and filtering for security events and analytics data",
      "support Chronicle UDM (Unified Data Model) search syntax and data structures"
