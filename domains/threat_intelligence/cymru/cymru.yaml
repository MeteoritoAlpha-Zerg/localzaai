      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates Team Cymru feed sources
    preconditions: |
      An existing Team Cymru API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Team Cymru feed sources using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given TeamCymruConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real feed sources, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List Team Cymru threat intelligence for selected feed sources in target
    preconditions: |
      An existing Team Cymru API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Team Cymru threat intelligence by way of connector tools;
      This list includes details of the threat intelligence to be listed in results; 
      These must be real threat intelligence data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_threat_intelligence.py

  - description: |
      Retrieve IP reputation scores and network insights for selected IPs
    preconditions: |
      An existing Team Cymru API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve IP reputation scores and network insights for the selected IPs as passed as params to the connector tools;
      This list only includes reputation data of the target IPs to be listed in results; 
      These must be real reputation data, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 5-test_ip_reputation.py

  - description: |

    preconditions: |
      An existing Team Cymru API credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to generate cyber threat analytics and enrichment data based on threat intelligence feeds;
      Results should contain meaningful threat metrics and enrichment insights;
      These must be real analytics data, and not simulated;

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the Team Cymru connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "TeamCymruConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which feed sources are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which feeds to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "handle Team Cymru-specific data structures like threat feeds, IP reputation scores, malware families, and enrichment data appropriately",
      "respect Team Cymru API rate limits and implement proper error handling for threat intelligence data",
      "support different Team Cymru services like Pure Signal, Scout, and Augury as needed",
      "handle time-based queries and filtering for threat intelligence and reputation data",
      "support Team Cymru's BGP and ASN lookup capabilities for network intelligence"
