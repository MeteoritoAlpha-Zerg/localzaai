    preconditions: |
      A valid authenticated session with Asana
    postconditions: |
      Per the configuration as contained in AsanaTarget as provided to AsanaConnectorTools, it is possible
      to get a list of workspaces along with their respective description and other relevant workspace details
      as may be relevant;
      Ensure that the respective get_asana_workspaces function in the AsanaConnectorTools is not hardcoding
      any return values;

    preconditions: |
      A valid authenticated session with Asana
    postconditions: |
      Connector successfully lists projects for the selected workspace provided as a param
      to the list projects tool

    preconditions: |
      A valid authenticated session with Asana
    postconditions: |
      Connector successfully lists tasks for the selected project provided as a param
      to the list tasks tool

tests:
  - description: |
      This checks to see that the connector is able to return a listing of tools
    preconditions: |
      A data connector implementation per the provided interfaces
    postconditions: |
      The data connector is able to provide a list of supported tools and interfaces
    function_to_run: !python/file 1-test_tools_interface.py

  - description: |
      This checks that the connector can successfully verify its connection
    preconditions: |
      A connector implementation adhering to ConnectorInterface is available as 'connector'
    postconditions: |
      The check_connection method returns True if the connector is correctly configured
    function_to_run: !python/file 2-test_connector_check_connection.py

  - description: |
      get_query_target_options enumerates Asana workspaces
    preconditions: |
      An existing Asana API token and credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve the list of Asana workspaces using get_query_target_options
      and to then use this to set the options in a given AsanaConnectorConfig which is 
      subclassed from ConnectorConfig - adheres to example API response in query_target_options.py;
      These must be real workspaces, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 3-test_query_target_options.py

  - description: |
      List Asana workspaces for selected Asana workspaces in target
    preconditions: |
      An existing Asana API token and credentials

      Possible to retrieve the list of Asana workspaces by way of connector tools;
      This list includes details of the workspaces to be listed in results; 
      These must be real workspaces, and not simulated;
    function_to_run: !python/file 4-test_list_workspaces.py

      An existing Asana API token and credentials
    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve a set of projects for the selected Asana workspace as passed as a param to the connector tools;
      This list only includes projects of the target workspace to be listed in results; 
      These must be real projects, and not simulated;

    postconditions: |
      Possible to retrieve a set of tasks for the selected Asana project as passed as a param to the connector tools;
      This list only includes tasks of the target project to be listed in results; 
      These must be real tasks, and not simulated;

      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the Asana connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "AsanaConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which workspaces are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which workspaces to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests"
