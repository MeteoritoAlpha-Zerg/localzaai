      Additional considerations for the generation of specifically the Salesforce connector 
      with regards to the connector framework as provided - please keep these strongly in mind
    value: [
      "SalesforceConnectorConfig should derive from ConnectorConfig, this is not a connector of type AlertProviderConnectorConfig config",
      "authentication should not be a tool, tools should handle authentication when used (so should not be explicitly exposed)",
      "utilize the query target options to determine which objects are valid for the target, and then use the target to select which objects to actually pull data from for the respective tools as shown in the unit tests",
      "handle Salesforce-specific error cases including API limits and governor limits",
      "use simple-salesforce instead of using httpx or raw requests to allow for more reliable authentication",
