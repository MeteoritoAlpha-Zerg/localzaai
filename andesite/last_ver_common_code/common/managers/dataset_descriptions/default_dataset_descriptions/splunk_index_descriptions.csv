"splunk","main-eval","This Splunk index integrates Zeek connection logs, Sysmon logs, and Windows Event Logs to provide a holistic view of network and system activities across Windows environments. It captures detailed network interactions from Zeek, deep system activity insights from Sysmon, and key system and application events from Windows logs. Use this index to perform complex queries, correlate events across different data types, and respond effectively to security incidents. Splunk sourcetypes are: zeek_conn (Zeek connection logs), sysmon_json (sysmon logs), and winevent_json (Windows event logs)."
"splunk","main-eval>>Computer","The name of the host for windows data."
"splunk","main-eval>>EventID","don't use this field. use EventCode instead."
"splunk","notable_demo","This Splunk index serves as a centralized repository for notable events and alerts, identifying and prioritizing potential security threats across your environment. It consolidates alerts generated by various analytics tools, correlating and refining them into actionable insights. Utilize this index to efficiently track security incidents, streamline incident response processes, and enhance overall security posture by focusing on the most critical issues."
